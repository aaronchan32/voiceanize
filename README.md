## About
---
This is an voice controlled inventory management mobile application created using Flutter, Firebase, and Alan AI. This project was created within the span of 2 months during Alan AI's Summer Fellowship of 2020. The application supports CRUD operations on a live database. The purpose of the application is to allow users to update a database handsfree - particularly users who can manage inventory hands-free.
